# Problem Statement
Create an application that can predict whether a candidate will join the organization he has been offered in or not. The data can be extracted from his resume, close-ended questionnaire, etc. 
Sometimes when a candidate has done well in all rounds of interviews, seems to be exactly right for the position and is a good cultural fit, hiring him or her is a no-brainer. Often when a candidate says I have a better offer, it usually refers to a better salary being offered by another company. 
So predict the probability of candidate joining the organization based on asking some question to the candidate.
